There are 23 columns, however, the documentation inn “GNCScheme.pdf” only lists 16 column labels, which does not match. Thus, it will be difficult to fully analyze the dataset as is. I cannot guess what all the columns are because many values are coded into numbers.\nOne possible option to consider is to remove the columns I am unsure of what they represent, which will limit some of my analysis.\nFor now, I will look at another dataset, Adaptation.csv, which looks at different adaptations of graphic novels (movie, tv series, novel, etc.).\n\nadapt_db.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\nAnimated feature film\nTatsumi\n2011-09-15\n\n\n1\n2\n219\nCrime thriller film\nA History of Violence\n2005-05-16\n\n\n2\n3\n7\nAdult animated science fiction film\nAkira\n1988-07-16\n\n\n3\n8\n225\nAnimated film\nAya of Yop City (French title: Aya de Yopougon)\n2013-07-17\n\n\n4\n9\n199\nComing-of-age romantic drama film\nBlue Is the Warmest Colour (French: La Vie d'A...\n2013-05-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadapt_db.columns = ['ID', 'BookID', 'Type', 'Title', 'Publication']\nadapt_db.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nBookID\nType\nTitle\nPublication\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\nAnimated feature film\nTatsumi\n2011-09-15\n\n\n1\n2\n219\nCrime thriller film\nA History of Violence\n2005-05-16\n\n\n2\n3\n7\nAdult animated science fiction film\nAkira\n1988-07-16\n\n\n3\n8\n225\nAnimated film\nAya of Yop City (French title: Aya de Yopougon)\n2013-07-17\n\n\n4\n9\n199\nComing-of-age romantic drama film\nBlue Is the Warmest Colour (French: La Vie d'A...\n2013-05-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince BookID is referenced in adapt_db, I will need book_db’s index to know which book is being adapted.\n\nadapt_db.Type.value_counts().sort_values().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(8,25))\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadapt_db.BookID.value_counts().sort_values().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(8,25))\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nI may be able to replace appearing values of BookID with their actual title for visualization purposes.\nNOTE: I still need to look for missing data, check ratio of missing values, and determine if there is data to be removed or imputed."
