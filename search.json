Thus, these columns should be dropped. I do not intend to work with the “DateOfBirth” column in future analysis, additionally the percentage of missing values is at 25%.

Methods to impute for categorical data are mode or replacing the value with “Unknown”.\nImputing with value “Unknown” will be for values that may be important, thus it is better to not substitute the missing value with something else.\n“Gender_ID”: This is a categorical value coded as 0 and 1.

    "text": "Author Dataset\nWhat conclusions can be made about the gender ratio of authors of graphic novels?\nIn the Explore section, I made a preliminary visualization of the gender ratio of authors before cleaning up the data. After cleaning up the dataset and imputing missing values, this is the updated visualization:\n\ngender_df = author_db.Gender_ID.value_counts().rename_axis('Gender_ID').reset_index(name='Counts')\nprint(gender_df)\n\n   Gender_ID  Counts\n0        1.0     290\n1        0.0      62\n\n\n\nfig = px.pie(gender_df, values='Counts', names='Gender_ID')\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nNote: Male is 1.0, Female is 0.0\nBefore imputing the data values, these were the previous statistics: * Male = 82.13 * Female = 17.87\nThere is no significant change with the new visualization since the number of missing values was not high.\nThe source website also has its own pie chart representing the gender of authors in their dataset.\nComparing their chart with mine, it is very similar where Male represents around 81.3% and Female about 18.7%. There is a slight difference where my visualizations show slightly higher percentages for Male and slightly less for Female. This slight difference is not significant and the same conclusion can be drawn where there is significantly more Male authors than Female authors of graphic novels.\nTo understand why there is a significantly male authorship of graphic novels, and how this affects graphic novels and their audience, I will research some materials to explain this observation.\nIn a FiveThirtyEight article “Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men” by Walt Hickey, it mentions that the writers and artists of comic books are “overwhelmingly men”. In addition to the creators themselves being mostly men, even the characters introduced in the comics are skewed towards men. According to Tim Hanley, a comics historian and researcher, men outnumber women roughly 9:1 in DC Comics, and roughly 7:1 in Marvel Comics.\nWhat are possible explanations for the skew towards male writers, and consequently male comic book characters? One possible explanation is perceived audience by the publishers. In an interview with Jason Aaron, writer of “Thor”, Jason explains that over time, they have started to cater towards the same audience. Additionally, during the 1960s and ’70s, comic books were sold in specialized shops that “catered mostly to a young, white, male audience” (Hickey).\nHowever, the known data pointing towards a male-dominated audience is contested by the observation of comic book convention attendance having a near even ratio between male and female, according to Hickey’s article. The audience may be much broader than what is believed as comics slowly shift to digital format, a more welcoming platform for those who may be intimidated by visiting a traditional comic book shop.\nWhy does one country have more graphic novel authors than others?\nTo answer this question, I will need to count the number of authors for each country mentioned in the author_db dataset. Then, graph these counts on a bar graph to visualize the data.\n\nauthor_db.CountryOfOriginID.value_counts().sort_values().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(8,20))\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many countries included in this dataset, but the top country leads significantly compared to the country following it. The country where most graphic novel authors originate from is the USA. Coming second and third most are the UK and Canada, relatively. It is important to note that there is a category for “Unknown” country of origin which is more than the count for the UK.\nThe source website also has a bar graph visualization representing the author’s country of origin here. In the source’s graph, USA goes beyond a count of 200. However, in my graph, USA’s count is just below count 200. There may also be other slight differences in count between my graph and the source’s visualization. It may be possible that the “Unknown” values in my graph were imputed as a different value, or these “Unknown” values were later known by the source and updated their visualization.\nThe standout observation here is the USA has the most graphic novel authors originating from there. To understand this, I will reference outside material.\nOn a broad perspective, there are various types of graphic novels, in which some are more popular than other formats in a country. For example, comic books are popular in the US while manga is popular in Japan.\nAlthough it seems that comics have a greater representation in the US, it is not necessarily true today as graphic novels are rising in popularity in other countries, such as in Japan, South Korea, and China. A plausible explanation for the large representation of US graphic novel authors in this dataset lies in how this dataset was aggregated. The project team working on this dataset (named GNC, Graphic Narrative Corpus) drew on several sources listed as such: “international comics prizes, academic databases, Amazon.com bestseller lists, online bibliographies and library collections, literary histories and international comics experts, as well as newspaper articles” (Hybrid Narrativity). The graphic novels were selected with the goal to balance popularity and prestige and to offset biases. Keeping these in mind, it is likely that several graphic novels will be chosen from a period of time when their popularity was rising. Based on this assumption, the period of time of when various types of graphic novels became popular may affect the data aggregated for an author’s country of origin.\nFor the US, comics have been around since the end of the 19th century. However, the Golden Age where its popularity rose came after the Great Depression around the late 1930s (PBS). Then, during World War II, the sales of comics of the superhero genre increased markedly. The end of the Golden Age is believed to be after the end of the war. However, the comics books, their stories and characters, left a deep impression, leading to them remaining popular today. Across the Atlantic Ocean, the beginnings of the UK’s golden age for comics were in the 1970s. Some of Britain’s best comics came from this time. The impact of Britain’s comics continued for another two decades (Gravett). On the opposite side of the world, Japan’s golden age of manga came later. Manga in Japan as been around for centuries. However, it was after World War II, around the 1950s, when the US’s occupation of Japan brought ideas and inspiration for the development of manga (Widewalls). Thus born are some the most well known mangas in history.\nWith a few examples of graphic novel popularity by time period, one plausible conclusion to make is that since the US entered graphic novel popularity earlier than other countries, it was more likely that the authors in the dataset would originate from the US. Other countries’ graphic novels rose to popularity later on, thus it did not occupy much of the information the GNC project team collected data from."

The graphic novel with the highest number of ratings is “The Complete Maus”. Considering rating the books based on both average rating and number of ratings, it appears that “Hellboy Volume 2” is the most popular. I will take a closer look at these two graphic novels.\nThe Hellboy comic series is created by Mike Mignola and published under Dark Horse Comics, making it considered an Indy comic as it is not under one of the two major publishing houses, Marvel and DC. Hellboy is a horror comic series that is well received by its readers. An article by Tom Speelman claims that Hellboy is “the best horror comic of all time.” This article goes on to analyze the writing, art, and style of storytelling that makes Hellboy a good read. Hellboy has won several awards such as the 2002 Eisner Award for “Best Limited Series” and the 2000 Harvey Award for “Best Artist”. Additionally, Hellboy has been adapted to several forms of media including live-action films, animated films, novels, and video games. With Hellboy being well spoken about, and adapted in several formats such that even those who don’t read the comic may know of it, it makes sense why Hellboy would be considered a popular series, if not a good recommendation.\nThe Maus series is a comic series created by Art Spiegelman. Spiegelman based Maus on interviews with his father who had survived Auschwitz during the Holocaust. The comic details and pictures a personal history of a survivor of the Holocaust, acting as a memoir and inspirational story. Those who have read Maus were inspired by the complex storytelling and creative representation of the characters in the comic. Maus acted as the foundation for graphic memoirs and documenting historical events. Many schools include Maus as part of the curriculum for middle and high school. There are also several school boards that ban reading Maus. The banning of Maus, contrary to restricting students from reading it, also leads to its rising popularity in online marketplaces such as Amazon, as is the case with Tennessee banning Maus. Due to Maus being a staple part of school curriculum, it is no surprise that there is a significantly large number of ratings for this comic. Additionally, because it is well received by its readers, largely students, it also maintains a high average rating. These support its standing as a popular graphic novel.\nDescribe any pattern(s) observed in when graphic novels were published?\nFirst, I will separate the year from the primary publishing date into a new column.\n\nbook_db[\"YearPub\"] = book_db[\"PrimPub\"].dt.year\nbook_db.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nTitle\nMentions\nPrimPub\nOriginalLanguage\nColorType\nAvgRating\nNoRatings\nYearPub\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n7 Miles A Second\n1\n1996-05-01\nEnglish\ncolour\n4.01\n382\n1996\n\n\n1\n1\nA Contract With God\n31\n1978-01-01\nEnglish\n--&gt; black&white\n4.07\n9146\n1978\n\n\n2\n2\nA Drifting Life\n8\n2008-11-20\nJapanese\n--&gt; black&white\n4.00\n2404\n2008\n\n\n3\n3\nA Small Killing\n5\n1991-10-03\nEnglish\ncolour\n3.40\n731\n1991\n\n\n4\n4\nTale of Sand\n0\n2011-12-14\nEnglish\ncolour\n3.78\n2386\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year of the primary publishing date for each book is now in its own column labeled “YearPub”. I will use this column to count the number of book published for each year represented in this dataset. To visualize the frequency of books published over time, I will create a histogram to visualize this data.\n\nplt.hist(book_db['YearPub'], bins=20)\nplt.ylabel('Frequency count')\nplt.xlabel('Year');\nplt.title('Number of Graphic Novels Published each Year')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above histogram, it can be observed that there is an increase in graphic novel publications over time. There is a gradual rise between the mid-1980s until 2010, then a slow decrease. There is a noticeable dip in the number of books published around the mid-1990s to 2000. After 2010, there is a slow decrease in the number of books published.\nBased on earlier analysis, graphic novels can generally be said to have become popular after World War II, roughly around the 1950s. The rise of graphic novels became more noticeable in the late 1990s. However, as seen in the histogram, there was a noticeable drop in graphic novel publishing in the late 1990s. This observation actually lines up with an even in the comic book industry known as the Great Comics Crash of 1996. There were two main causes for this: the direct market and the collector boom.\nThe direct market refers to how comics publishers distribute comics directly to comic book shops. Because these shops were not covered by The Comics Code, they can sell comics that don’t have the Code approval (tvtropes). Thus, instead of “stripping” and returning unsold copies, stores could take a gamble of predicting customer demand and selling the extra copies (tvtropes). In the 1990s, two major direct-market distributors drastically reduce their ordering requirements, leading to a large amound of “comics dealers” setting up shop, most of them inexperienced. This would lead to many businesses not being able to last for long if money did not circulate.\nThe collector boom is considered the biggest factor of the Crash. Early comics became more valuable over time because most of them did not survive. Thus came the thought that comics being released today could become valuable in the future. This resulted in these “comics dealers” to over-order a large amount of comics for a demand that does not yet exist. Several marketing tactics were deployed in this period to appeal to the collectors’ market, such as introducing more new characters. Many changes happened in how comics were written and marketed, often at the detriment of the writing and cohesivity of the comic book universes.\nThere is much more to be said about the Comics Crash but you can read more details about it here. After the Crash, graphic novels continued to rise in the industry. Around 2010, there is another noticeable decline in number of published graphic novels. This may be due to the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis, in which the world faced a large economic crisis. This slowed down the economy significantly as it took several years to recover from. There is a small rise afterwards toward the present, which may be attributed to the move from physical to digitized graphic novels, reaching a much wider audience than before."
